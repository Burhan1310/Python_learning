So i'm basically working on a project where the 
computer takes a word from a list of words and 
jumbles it up for the user. there's only one problem:
 I don't want to keep having to write tons of words
  in the list, so i'm wondering if there's a way to 
  import a ton of random words so even I don't know
   what it is, and then I could enjoy the game too? 
   This is the coding of the 
whole program, it only has 6 words that i put in:'''

# index
print('index:', demo[45])

# negative indexing
print('negative indexing: ', demo[-2])

# length
print(len(demo))

# slicing
print(demo[:45])
print(demo[420:])
